# Problem: We have a dataset related to companies with the following columns:
# R&D Spend     Administration      Marketing Spend   Profit
# We want to predict a company's profit based on R&D spend, administration and marketing spend.

companies = pd.read_csv(r'C:\Users\Adrian\OneDrive\Documents\MachineLearning\DataSets\Companies\1000_companies.csv')
# Get X and Y
x = companies.iloc[:, :-2].values # We extract all columns except the last which is used for the answer
y = companies.iloc[:, 4].values # This is the last column used for answer
# Split data
x_train, x_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(x, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=0) # 20% for test
# Create the model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(x_train, y_train)
# Predict
y_pred = model.predict(x_test)
# Evaluate
print(r2_score(y_test, y_pred)) # R squared value > 0.9 proves the model is good
